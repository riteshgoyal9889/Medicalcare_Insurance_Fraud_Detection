# Big Data Technologies Project with MongoDB

## Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate the integration of **MongoDB** with big data technologies to handle, process, and analyze large datasets efficiently. The goal is to utilize MongoDB's flexible schema, scalability, and querying capabilities in conjunction with big data tools to provide insights from large-scale datasets. This project includes data ingestion, storage, processing, and retrieval operations, emphasizing performance and scalability.

## Features

- **MongoDB-based data storage**: Uses MongoDB as the main database for storing semi-structured data.
- **Data ingestion pipeline**: Supports large-scale data ingestion using Python scripts.
- **Querying and Data Retrieval**: MongoDBâ€™s powerful querying system allows for flexible data retrieval and aggregation.
- **Data Analysis and Reporting**: Supports real-time data analytics on large datasets.
- **Scalability**: Capable of scaling horizontally to handle growing data needs.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following installed on your machine:

- **MongoDB** (version 4.4 or higher)
- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for running the `.ipynb` files)
- [Other tools if applicable, e.g., Hadoop, Spark, or Kafka if used]

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    cd yourproject
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    Make sure you are in the project directory and then install the necessary Python libraries by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up MongoDB**:
    - Install MongoDB from the [official MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
    - Start the MongoDB service:
      ```bash
      mongod
      ```
    - Create a database and collection that will store the ingested data (this can be done via the MongoDB shell or as part of the script in the project).

4. **Configure MongoDB Connection**:
    Make sure the `main.ipynb` or any Python scripts that access MongoDB have the correct connection string to your local or cloud MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

## Usage

1. **Running the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the `main.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook main.ipynb
     ```
   - Follow the instructions inside the notebook to execute each cell and interact with the MongoDB database. The notebook contains steps for:
     - Ingesting data into MongoDB
     - Querying the data
     - Performing aggregation operations for data analysis

2. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Load datasets (either included in the project or your own datasets) into the MongoDB collection via the script or notebook cells.
   
3. **Data Processing and Analysis**:
   - Use the provided MongoDB queries and Python scripts to analyze the data. For example, you might perform aggregations to calculate trends or visualize data using plots.

## MongoDB Configuration

The MongoDB setup includes:
- Database: `bigdata_project_db`
- Collection: `data_collection`
- Indexes: If necessary, indexes can be created to optimize query performance, especially for large datasets.
  
You can modify the database and collection names in the script or notebook if needed.

## File Structure

- `main.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the main code for data ingestion, querying, and analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the list of Python libraries needed, such as `pymongo` for MongoDB interactions.
- `config.py` (if applicable): A configuration file for MongoDB connection strings and other settings.
- `data/`: (Optional) A directory that may contain sample datasets for testing.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following Python packages (as listed in `requirements.txt`):
- `pymongo`: To interact with MongoDB.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib` or `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- [Any other dependencies specific to your project.]
